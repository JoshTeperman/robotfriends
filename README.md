# About
This was my first ever React App ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥\
This project was created as part of Andrei Neaogie's Udemy Course: 'The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery'. 

I used this course to learn the basics of React. It was created using create-react-app, and through it I learned how to:
- build Components 
- build Containers
- use props
- use props.children to 'wrap' components
- manage component state 
- use lifecycle methods
- use object destructuring
- use idiomatic JSX syntax
- use API data to populate components
